# 1. Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

The study of Twitter Sentiment Analysis investigates whether there is a relationship with the sentiment of Twitter content and the overall happiness of a state within the United States. 
As part of this analysis, relevant data from Twitter and WalletHub were collected from their respective sites using Python, assessed for cleanliness, and cleansed as necessary. 
Once cleaned, key attributes of the Twitter and State Happiness Data were investigated for initial insight and then deeper analyses were conducted to interpret the data and perform predictive analysis.
