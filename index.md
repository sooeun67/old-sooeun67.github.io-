## 1. Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

The study of Twitter Sentiment Analysis investigates whether there is a relationship with the sentiment of Twitter content and the overall happiness of a state within the United States. 
As part of this analysis, relevant data from Twitter and WalletHub were collected from their respective sites using Python, assessed for cleanliness, and cleansed as necessary. 
Once cleaned, key attributes of the Twitter and State Happiness Data were investigated for initial insight and then deeper analyses were conducted to interpret the data and perform predictive analysis.

## 2. Africa Data Visualization Project

This project is a visual exploration of the relationship between Africaâ€™s economic development and its infrastructure. 
Sub-Saharan Africa has been evaluated as being at the bottom of developing regions in terms of infrastructure performance, and numbers of obstacle for growth and poverty reduction across the region. 
The aim is to answer questions such as: How have infrastructure changes in Sub-Saharan Africa led or not led to economic growth in the past thirty years? 
Does growth in communications infrastructure, such as internet and cellphones, lead to economic growth? 
Are there differences in outcomes by the income-level of the country? How does inflation and vulnerable employment factor in?

## 5. Natural Language Processing Hackathon

This is a full report of hackathon that our team was selected as best group and invited to Analytics Department Showcase.
Our team identified the assigned language by accessing the server/database and conducted NLP procesing such as tokenizing, stemming. We also generated scores and labels for the document including Part of Speech(PoS) Tagging and Named Entity Recognition(NER). My main role was to create an elasticsearch index that represents our test data documents and includes the result of our analytic.

## 6. Korean Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
### Natural Language Processing Project

In this study, we explore various machine learning (ML) tools and natural language processing (NLP) methods to perform a prediction analysis of movie ratings. Prior to the prediction process, this paper presents data collection and step of data pre-processing with the introduction of Python libraries and packages available.
